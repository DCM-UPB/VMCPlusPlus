`ut1/`: check that the FFNNWaveFunction behaves correctly making a comparison between a very simple neural network and a plain written wf that reproduces the neural network.



## Unit Test 2

`ut2/`: check the ParticleArray class.



## Unit Test 3

`ut3/`: check the EuclidianParticleDistance class.
